## Introduction
---------------

The HartsyCore Extension is the backbone of the Hartsy extension framework for SwarmUI. It creates a new tab called "Hartsy" and a sub-tab for each extension. This extension is required for other Hartsy extensions to function properly.

## Features
------------

* Creates a new "Hartsy" tab in SwarmUI.
* Adds a sub-tab for each Hartsy extension.
* Provides a consistent and organized interface for all Hartsy extensions.

## Prerequisites
----------------

Before you install the HartsyCore Extension, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

* You need to have SwarmUI installed on your system. If you don't have it installed, you can download it from [here](https://github.com/mcmonkeyprojects/SwarmUI).
* HartsyCore is required for other Hartsy extensions to function. Make sure to install this extension first.

## Installation
--------------

To install the HartsyCore Extension, follow these steps:

1. Close your SwarmUI instance and navigate to the `SwarmUI/src/Extensions` directory.
2. Clone the HartsyCore repository there. Open cmd and `cd` to the directory above and run `git clone https://github.com/HartsyAI/SwarmUI-HartsyCore`.
3. Make sure you have run `update-windows.bat` or `update-linuxmac.sh` to recompile SwarmUI. This only needs to be done on first install.
4. Restart your SwarmUI instance and refresh your browser. You should now have a new tab called "Hartsy".

## Usage
--------

1. When you open your SwarmUI instance, you will see a new tab called "Hartsy". All Hartsy extensions will be under this tab.
2. Each sub-tab will correspond to a specific Hartsy extension.

## Configuration
----------------

The HartsyCore Extension does not require any configuration. It sets up the necessary tabs and sub-tabs for other Hartsy extensions to use.

## Troubleshooting
-----------------

If you encounter any issues, check these common solutions before you open an issue on GitHub.

* Check the logs for any error messages or warnings.
* Ensure that the extension is properly installed and configured.
* If you still have issues, open an issue on GitHub or join the [Hartsy Discord Community](https://discord.gg/g9WxrANX4z).
